'''Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable called alien_color and assign
it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.
•Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green.If it is, print a message that the
player just earned 5 points.
•Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails.
(The version that fails will have no output.)'''

#colour of alien killed will be Green
alien_color = 'green'

#using if statement
#if the alien color is green player wins 5 points
if alien_color == 'green' :
    print("YAAYY! You killed green alien, 5 points earned")
    # now the color of the alien killed will be YELLOW
    #using another color other than green will make u fail

    if alien_color == 'yellow' :
     print ( "YAAYY! You killed green alien, 5 points earned")
